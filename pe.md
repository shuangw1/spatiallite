In this practical execerise, we introduce how to manage a spatial database using spatialite. In the GIS industry, there are multiple spatial databases, such as ESRI geodatabase, postgresql(with postgis), Oracle, and spatialite. These databases are designed for database of different size and in different uages. Spatialite is a file based database, derived from sqlite and supported by a few open source GIS libraries. It is worth noting that, compared to other existing databases, Spatailite can apply for mobile development and multiple operating systems. Since Spatialite can manage both spatial data and common attribute data tables in one database file, it actually makes the geospatial data management much easier if compared with Shapefiles which needs multiple files to store one piece of geospatial data. Besides, SpatiaLite has extended the common SQL functions and supported a series of spatial functions to conduct advanced spatail queries or joins. Thus, to get familiarw with its functions and usages, this practical exercise will introduce how to build a spatialite database, create data tables, insert geospatial data, and eventually visualize and analyse the data in a geographical layout. This execerise actually extends the [`02_geosearch.py`](../03_bot/02_geosearch.py) from the praticial exercise of last week, the harvested data will save in a spatialite database instead of a csv file. Okay, let us get started!


## 1. Environment setup

To setup the working environment, you will need to install QGIS 3.+. We also assume you have already install Anocanda and PyCharm. QGIS is an integrated GISystem, which has been considered as the open source alternatives to ArcGIS. To install QGIS, make sure its version is greater than 3.0. Please download it from [https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In this practical exercise, we mainly use its `DB Manager` function for spatial data operations.

## 2. Manage geospatial database using SpatiaLite

### 2.1 Install Prerequisite python libray

Above all, please install one required python libraries - sqlite3. To install,  execute the following shell script on command prompt (if a windows user) or terminal (if a Mac or Linux user).

```powershell
pip install sqlite3
```

Once installed, please execute the script [`tw2db.py`](tw2db.py) under the [04_data folder](./) on PyCharm. We will offer a step-by-step instruction of this piece of python script as below.

### 2.2 Create a spatialite database

The most convenient way to create a spatialite database is to use QGIS. Open a QGIS (version >3.0) application. In the browser panel on the left, please right-click the SpatiaLite icon. In the pop-up dropdown menu, press `Create Database...`. The name of this database is `tweets.db`, which is stored under the [assets](assets/) folder.

![](img/create-database.png)

After inputing the database name, an empty spatial datbase will be created. We can find this newly created database by navigating to its location.

![](img/save-database.png)

### 2.3 Initialize a data table

In order to properly use this database, we will do several queries to construct a data table within this database. The sql statement can be found in [`create_table.sql`](create_table.sql).

Navigate from `Database` on the main menu bar to `DB Manager...`. In the pop-up interface, Right-click the SpatiaLite item on the provider panel to build a new connection. Use this `New Connection` conects to `tweets.db`.

![](img/open-spatialite.png)

On the DB Manger interface, Navigate from `Database` on the main menu, and then open up the `SQL window.` In the popup window, please input the first SQL statement, and press `Execute`.

![](img/query-spatialite.png)


Once executed, a new table named `geotweets` is created. This data table has several fields, such as id, username, created_at, lat, lng, and text.


### 2.3 Data Collection

The `on_data` function processes the streamed-in/input data. Let us walk through this function in deatail.

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect(self.dbfile)
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

A spatialite database located at `self.dbfile` will be connected, and a cursor is created for this database as well.


```python
if (time.time() - self.start_time) < self.limit:
        ...
        ...
else:
    conn.close()
    print ("finished.")
    return False
```

This crawler will terminate after reaching the predefined time limit `self.limit`. To stop the database connection, a statement `conn.close()` will be executed.


```python
datajson = json.loads(data)
print (datajson)
id = datajson['id']
username = datajson['user']['screen_name']
created_at = datajson['created_at']
text = datajson['text'].strip().replace("\n", "").replace('"', '\"').replace("'", "\"")

# process the geo-tags
if datajson['coordinates'] == None:
    bbox = datajson['place']['bounding_box']['coordinates'][0]
    lng = (bbox[0][0] + bbox[2][0]) / 2.0
    lat = (bbox[0][1] + bbox[1][1]) / 2.0
else:
    lng = datajson['coordinates']['coordinates'][0]
    lat = datajson['coordinates']['coordinates'][1]
```

The streamed-in data is loaded to a json object `datajson`. A json object is easier to process and destructurize. Then, the `id`, `username`, and `created_at`, `text` as well as the geographic data are extracted.


```python
insert_record_sql = "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO geotweets (id, username, created_at, lng, lat, text) VALUES (%d, '%s', '%s', %f, %f, '%s')" % (id, username, created_at, lng, lat, text)
cursor.execute(insert_record_sql)
conn.commit()

record = (id, username, created_at, lng, lat, text)
print (record)
```

As shown, new records will be inserted to this database, if a record has already been inserted, this record will not be inserted to the data table. To observe the content of the updated record, the content of record will be shown on the console of PyCharm since we print it to the console.


If `tw2db.py` is executed on PyCharm, a list of records will be inserted to the data table `geotweets` of the database `tweets.db` under [assets](assets/). To view the inserted data table, execute the following sql statement `select * from geotweets`.

![](img/datatable.png)

### 2.4 Geo-enable the data table


We will add a geographic column `geom` to enable the data table `geotweets` to store geospatial datasets. To add a geographic column, run the sql statement below on the query window of QGIS's DB Manager.

```sql
-- Create the geometry column
SELECT AddGeometryColumn('geotweets', 'geom', 4326, 'POINT', 'XY', 0);
```

After executing this sql statement, you can see a new `NULL` column was added to the data table.

![](img/add-geom-column.png)


Then, The geom column will be filled with the point indicating where the geotag for the tweet. The point can be made by the `lat` and `lng` column. Notably, since it is a geographic point, we will also assign a default projection `WGS 84` to this point. The EPSG id of WGS 84 is `4326`. So, the sql statement below will be executed.

> EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset (also EPSG registry) is a public registry of spatial reference systems, Earth ellipsoids, coordinate transformations and related units of measurement. Each entity is assigned an EPSG code between 1024-32767, along with a standard machine-readable well-known text (WKT) representation. The dataset is actively maintained by the IOGP Geomatics Committee.
> - EPSG:4326 - WGS 84, latitude/longitude coordinate system based on the Earth's center of mass, used by the Global Positioning System among others.
> - EPSG:3857 - Web Mercator projection used for display by many web-based mapping tools, including Google Maps and OpenStreetMap.


```sql
-- Update the geometry column
update geotweets set geom = MakePoint(lng, lat, 4326);
```

Then, a geographic column will be created. Pressing the first button to the left on the main menu to refresh the DB manager. If switching to the `Preview` tab of the main window, we can actually see a map of the visulizaed data from the `geotweets` data table.

### 2.5 And more

#### Build spatial data index and compute boundingbox

To speed up the data search or operation, the spatial data index can be built and the boundingbox can be computed. To do so, please switch to the `info` tab and click on the `find out` and `create it` links.

![](img/index.png)

#### Become a Guru of Spatialite

A spatial databse supports spatial query and join. For example, you can generate buffers around each geo-tagged tweet, check which of the geo-tagged tweets fall in the city limits of Seattle. You can compose a (spatial) query on the textbox of the `Query` tab, or you can open the `SQL Query Builder` to help you compose an advanced query. As shown below.

- [A quick tutorial to SpatiaLite](http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-tutorial-2.3.1.html)


#### Visualize data stored in a spatialite database

The geospatial data from a spatialite can be visualize and further analyzed in a QGIS environment. To visualize a spatial data table, you need to open `QGIS`, navigate to the `Browser Panel` on the top left, in the `spatialite` categorize, find the spatial date table inside of a spatial database. By clicking on the data table, a new layer will be added to the `Layers Panel` and the layer will be simutanously visualized in the main panel.

![](img/map.png)

Then, you can conduct any supported spatial anlytical functions onto this spatial layer. If you prefer using ArcGIS platform, you can export the spatial data table as a shapefile for later use in ArcGIS. To do so, right click on the layer `geotweets` in the `Layers Panel`. On the dropdown Menu, choose `Export--> Save Features As...`. On the popup window, choose `ESRI Shapefile` as the export format.

#### Import data to a Spatialite

SpatiaLite can be used to manage spreadsheet and most types of geospatial data. To import data to Spatialite is straightforward. We will walk through the steps as follows. **Note:** You can insert raster data or satelite image as a binary field. We would not introduce in this instruction, if you are interested in, please read this tutorial on [RasterLite](http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/rasterlite-docs/rasterlite-how-to.pdf).

In the [assets](assets/), you will find two data files, in terms of a polygon data [states.geojson](assets/states.geojson) showing the administration boundary of all states in the U.S., and another spreadsheet [pop.csv] containing the population data of each state estimated in 2014 census.

Drag and drop these two files respectively to the `Layers Panel`. Then you will see two layers are listed in the panel and only the states layer is visualized in the map panel. Apparently, the `pop.csv` does not have geometrical feature, so it would not be visualized.

![](img/import.png)

Drag and drop these two layers from the `Layer Panel` to the database file `tweets.db` in the `Browser Panel`. Then, you can immediately see two extra tables are added to the database `tweets.db`.

![](img/drag-to-db.png)

By doing so, the database `tweets.db` can store and manage all the three data tables, in terms of `geotweets` - geographic point feature, `states` - a polygon feature and `pop` - an attribute table. Apparently, it is relatively convenient to manage (spatial) databse with spatialite. You do not need to worry about storing all the assoicted files like shapefile, and it is also very easy for data migration and reuse.

## 3. Deliverable

You are expected to walk through this instruction, practice how to store the geo-tagged tweets to a spatialite and visualize it in QGIS platform. More importantly, by learning this practical exercise, you are expected to manage the research data onto a spatial database.

So, to submit your deliverable, please,
- Share a spatialite database of your research data to the **Canvas Dropbox** of this practical exercise. (30 POINTS)

- Along with the database, please also attach a word document or a pdf file  to describe what the tables/layers in the database are and how they are related to your research questions. (20 POINTS)


**Note:** Lab assignments are required to be submitted electronically to Canvas unless stated otherwise. Efforts will be made to have them graded and returned within one week after they are submitted.Lab assignments are expected to be completed by the due date. ***A late penalty of at least 10 percentage units will be taken off each day after the due date.*** If you have a genuine reason(known medical condition, a pile-up of due assignments on other courses, ROTC,athletics teams, job interview, religious obligations etc.) for being unable to complete work on time, then some flexibility is possible. However, if in my judgment you could reasonably have let me know beforehand that there would likely be a delay, and then a late penalty will still be imposed if I don't hear from you until after the deadline has passed. For unforeseeable problems,I can be more flexible. If there are ongoing medical, personal, or other issues that are likely to affect your work all semester, then please arrange to see me to discuss the situation. There will be NO make-up exams except for circumstances like those above.
